The process from requisition to hire is exceptionally fast i.e 17 days vs 39 days which i can assume suggests that the internal workflows, quick decision-making, and efficient scheduling have been streamlined. One can infer that speed is a major competitive advantage in securing top talent. However the low offer acceptance rate may indicate that this speed may be coming at the expense of quality or candidate experience thus we might be rushing candidates through or making offers to people who aren't fully committed or properly vetted.

We can see that the combination of a very short "Open Days" period  and a high number of declined offers suggests we may not be building a large or qualified enough candidate base. We can alse see that closing job advertisments after only 5 days severely limits the number of potential applicants who see the role. This can force recruiters to choose from a smaller, potentially less-ideal pool of candidates, leading to more offers being declined or candidates failing interviews.

Our internal teams are highly efficient at approving requisitions  and posting jobs. 
I thing that the  focus needs to shift from internal process speed to external market effectiveness.

We can also note that a low offer acceptance rate, especially with notes like "salary expectation too high," may point out to a disparity between what compensation packages we offer and what is offered by the market / what the customer expects . We are losing candidates at the final hurdle to competitors who offer more attractive compensation or benefits. This is a critical area for review.
